Is there a way to use this method
    <!-- if len(recipe['description']) < 3 or len(recipe['instructions']) < 3:
    flash("Field must be at least 3 characters", "recipe") -->
and have it flash messages based on the key item


Is there a difference putting database name within the class vs outside?
    <!-- class Recipe:
        db = "recipe_share_erd"

        def __init__(self, data):
            self.id = data['id'] -->


For if else statements, can we omit else?
